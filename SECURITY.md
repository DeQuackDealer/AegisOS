# Security Policy
AegisOS Security Policy
1. Security Overview

AegisOS is designed with a security-first and offline-capable architecture. Core security features operate locally and do not rely on continuous internet connectivity. While reasonable measures are taken to improve system safety and integrity, no system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.

2. No Warranty / No Guarantee

AegisOS is provided “as is” and “as available.”
We make no warranties, express or implied, regarding security, reliability, availability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

We do not guarantee that:

The operating system will be free from vulnerabilities

All threats will be detected or prevented

The software will be uninterrupted or error-free

3. Limitation of Liability

5. Offline Builder & Licensing Disclaimer
