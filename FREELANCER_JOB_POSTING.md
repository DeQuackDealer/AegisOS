Build Aegis OS Linux ISO - $30 USD

I need someone to build a bootable Linux operating system (ISO file) from source code using Buildroot and verify it works. Here's what you'll do: Copy the aegis-os-freemium folder to a USB stick, plug it into a Linux VM (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, 50GB+ disk, 8GB+ RAM), then run these 4 commands: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb, cd /mnt/usb/aegis-os-freemium, chmod +x build.sh, and ./build.sh. The script compiles automatically (1-2 hours) with no intervention needed - you just monitor it. When done, verify the build by checking: (1) ISO file exists at output/aegis-os-freemium.iso, (2) file size is ~2.1GB, (3) calculate SHA-256 checksum and verify integrity, (4) attempt to boot the ISO in VirtualBox to confirm it boots successfully. Take screenshots of the successful build completion message and the bootable ISO running. Send me: the ISO file (~2.1GB), build completion screenshot, boot verification screenshot, and SHA-256 checksum. Total active work is about 30 minutes, plus 1-2 hours automated build. I'll provide the code folder. Budget: $30 USD.
