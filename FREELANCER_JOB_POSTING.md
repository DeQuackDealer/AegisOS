Build Aegis OS Linux ISO - $30 USD

I need someone to build a bootable Linux operating system (ISO file) from source code using Buildroot. Here's what you'll do: Copy the aegis-os-freemium folder to a USB stick, plug it into a Linux VM (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, 50GB+ disk, 8GB+ RAM), then run these 4 commands: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb, cd /mnt/usb/aegis-os-freemium, chmod +x build.sh, and ./build.sh. The script compiles automatically (1-2 hours) with no intervention needed - you just monitor it. When done, send me the resulting ISO file (~2.1GB) from output/aegis-os-freemium.iso. Total active work is about 30 minutes. I'll provide the code folder. Must deliver: the ISO file, proof of successful build (screenshot), SHA-256 checksum verification, and file transfer. Simple task, clear success criteria. Budget: $30 USD.
