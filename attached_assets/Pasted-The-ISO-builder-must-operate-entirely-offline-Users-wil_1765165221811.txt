The ISO builder must operate entirely offline. Users will download a single packaged installer from our website, and this installer must already contain all assets, templates, scripts, and components needed to assemble the final ISO without downloading anything else.

The current system attempts to download a .hta file and relies on external files, which leads to runtime failures and breaks the licensing system. Replace all external download behavior with a fully self-contained workflow.

Your task is to fully fix, optimize, and stabilize the ISO builder system while maintaining compatibility with the existing .hta implementation but also suggesting modern replacements that would improve reliability.

Requirements and Fixes
1. Remove All External Downloads

The installer must not reach out to the internet at any point.

The .hta file must be packaged internally or replaced by another local execution format.

All filesystem templates, data chunks, kernels, modules, and edition configurations must be stored within the installer itself.

2. Fix the Existing .hta Implementation

Even though we’re considering alternatives, the current .hta must still function correctly until replaced.

Fix the following issues internally:

Resolve the “unknown runtime error”

Fix markup/JS errors

Ensure all scripts execute consistently

Ensure Windows runtime launches the .hta without dependency issues

Guarantee stability across Windows 10/11 environments

3. Repair and Harden the Licensing System

Correct any validation logic, hashing, encryption, or key handling problems

Ensure valid licenses always pass

Prevent false “invalid license” errors

Make validation 100% offline-safe and reproducible

Add graceful fallback if a license file is corrupted or missing

4. Make the ISO Build Process Fully Offline

The builder must reliably:

Unpack included filesystem templates

Insert kernel, drivers, and edition-specific modules

Integrate:

AI security bot

AI task optimizer

Built-in upscalers

Prebuilt training environments

Containers, cookers, and runtimes

Gamer Edition assets (game engine, optimizers, GPU tuning templates)

AI Dev Edition assets (ML frameworks, model runners, dataset prep tools)

Generate a verified, bootable, reproducible ISO

Perform checksum validation

Output the finished ISO locally so the user can flash with Balena Etcher

5. Recommended Modern Replacements for .hta

You don’t need to rewrite the .hta now, but provide implementation suggestions for a later upgrade.

Option A — Node.js/Electron Mini Runtime

Small embedded Node runtime

Scriptable

Cross-platform

More stable than .hta

Option B — Python Embedded Installer

Bundled Python (no system Python required)

Runs on all Windows versions

Easy to script the build pipeline

Extremely reliable

Option C — Rust or Go-Based CLI Builder

Fast

Minimal overhead

Easily produces .exe without actual compiling on Replit

Stable output and easy ISO-building routines

Option D — PowerShell GUI (WPF/XAML)

Native Windows

Zero web dependencies

Much safer than .hta

Runtime already exists on all modern Windows systems

Option E — C# WinForms/WPF Single-File EXE

Compiles to one executable

Includes all resources

No external dependencies

Works even on weak or outdated laptops

6. Output Requirements

Deliver back a fully corrected system where:

The builder is self-contained

The .hta works reliably until replaced

Licensing is functional

ISO generation is offline, consistent, and robust

Replacement options are clearly described for future migration

Final output ISO is ready for Balena Etcher without the user needing internet access
