Review and refine the complete user flow for how users obtain, verify, and build the operating system across both freemium and paid editions. The process must be streamlined, offline-capable, secure, and consistent.

1. Freemium Edition Flow

The user downloads a single executable file (currently .hta or a recommended modern alternative).

This executable contains all required assets, templates, and scripts to build the full freemium ISO locally without any internet connection.

When the user opens the executable, it immediately begins the ISO build process using the embedded resources.

After the ISO is generated, the user is instructed to use Balena Etcher to flash the ISO onto a USB drive.

The entire freemium workflow must be:

Self-contained

Offline-safe

Free of runtime errors

Consistent across devices

2. Paid Edition Flow

The user purchases a license through the website.

After successful payment, the system provides:

A valid license key

A download link for the paid-edition executable (same structure as the freemium builder but containing premium resources)

When launching the executable:

The user must enter the license key.

The builder verifies the key offline.

If the key is invalid → abort ISO generation with a clear error message.

If the key is valid → proceed to build the ISO for the selected paid edition (Gamer Edition, AI Dev Edition, etc.)

The builder then generates the fully configured ISO using the embedded premium assets.

The user finishes by flashing the ISO via Balena Etcher.

3. Requirements for Replit AI

You must ensure:

The executable (whether .hta or a modern replacement) contains all resources internally.

No external downloads occur during ISO generation.

The licensing system is stable, correct, and resistant to false negatives.

Valid licenses always allow the ISO to build.

Invalid licenses always block the build.

Both freemium and paid versions use the same user flow except for the license gate.

All messaging and instructions shown to users are clear, consistent, and polished.

The ISO generation process must be reproducible and offline-capable.

4. Optional Recommendation Section

Provide suggestions for safer and more modern alternatives to .hta, such as:

Embedded Python runtime scripts

Node/Electron bootstrapper

Go or Rust single-file CLI

PowerShell GUI wrapper

C# WinForms/WPF single-file executable

These alternatives should support offline operation, reliable execution, and bundling of all required resources for ISO creation.
